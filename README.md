###Primary
As a runner, in order to track my training, I want to keep a diary of my runs.

As a runner, in order to keep track of each run, I want to save data about date, place, distance, time to complete run, photo, and a "diary entry" about what happened and how I felt.

As a runner, in order to vizualize my data, I want to be able to view past runs and future scheduled runs on a calendar.

As a runner, in order to keep track of my goals, I want to specify certain future events as "races."

As a runner, in order to review, edit, or delete runs that may have already been entered, I want to click the name of the run on the calendar and see the enter/edit run page with previously entered data pre-populated in the fields. From there I can change data and save the entry, delete the entry, or close the entry without making any changes.
